# DSC180 - Models for Creditworthiness 

Machine Learning for credit score calculation. 

## Description

In the complex landscape of financial services, creditworthiness is vital for managing financial risks, ensuring economic stability, and making reasonable lending decisions. The FICO score, the standard measure of creditworthiness, is updated depending on the creditor’s reporting schedule, typically ranging from one month to forty-five days. As a result, the FICO score fails to capture the rapid changes in an individual’s financial behavior or the emergence of new financial risks. Our technique aims to refine this process and update the score within two weeks, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of creditworthiness assessment. 

## Installation

Before you can run the project, you need to install the necessary Python packages. This project depends on several third-party libraries, which are listed below:

- `numpy`: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- `pandas`: An open-source data analysis and manipulation tool.
- `torch`: An open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.
- `nltk`: A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data (Natural Language Toolkit).
- `transformers`: A library by Hugging Face offering state-of-the-art general-purpose architectures for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- `scikit-learn`: A simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.

To install these packages, you can use `pip`, which is the package installer for Python. Simply run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Install numpy, pandas, torch, and nltk
pip install *numpy
* can be pandas /torch/ nltk

# Install transformers and scikit-learn
pip install transformers
pip install scikit-learn
```bash
