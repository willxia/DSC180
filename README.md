# DSC180 - Models for Creditworthiness 

Machine Learning for credit score calculation. 

## Description

In the complex landscape of financial services, creditworthiness is vital for managing financial risks, ensuring economic stability, and making reasonable lending decisions. The FICO score, the standard measure of creditworthiness, is updated depending on the creditor’s reporting schedule, typically ranging from one month to forty-five days. As a result, the FICO score fails to capture the rapid changes in an individual’s financial behavior or the emergence of new financial risks. Our technique aims to refine this process and update the score within two weeks, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of creditworthiness assessment.
