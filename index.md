# Background Information: Why is Credit Score Important? 

In the dynamic realm of financial services, determining creditworthiness is essential for risk management, economic stability, and informed lending decisions. Traditionally anchored by the FICO score, the assessment of creditworthiness relies on creditors' periodic reporting, typically spanning one to forty-five days. This time frame, however, introduces a significant shortfall in the traditional scoring system: its inability to promptly encapsulate the nuances of an individual's financial behavior and emerging risks, thereby compromising the decision-making process in lending.

## How we approach this issue:

Machine Learning (ML) Utilization: Harnessing advanced ML models to devise a "Cash Score," aiming at a real-time reflection of creditworthiness.
Feature Engineering: Incorporating detailed financial indicators such as income, balance, and spending patterns to enhance prediction accuracy.
Objective: To refine creditworthiness assessment, making it more efficient and accurate.
